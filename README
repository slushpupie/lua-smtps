This is an implementation of SMTPS for Lua. 
It depends on LuaSocket and LuaSec to be useful. 

Many thanks to Diego Nehab for providing the LuaSocket source for which to work
from.

The smtps module extends the socket.smtp module, so all documentation for the 
socket.smtp module apply here.  The default port is changed to 465, and the send
function also accepts any of the paramaters that the ssl.wrap params accepts.

To install, place smtps.lua wherever you need the module to be.
