This is an implementation of SMTPS for Lua. 
It depends on LuaSocket and LuaSec to be useful. 

Many thanks to Diego Nehab for providing the LuaSocket source for which to work
from.

The smtps module extends the socket.smtp module, so all documentation for the 
socket.smtp module apply here.  The default port is changed to 465, and the send
function also accepts any of the paramaters that the ssl.wrap params accepts.

test.lua shows an example usage of the smtps module.  moduleless.lua shows an
example of how to do SMTPS without installing a module (useful for MiOS UPnP Lua
where installing modules is not possible)

To install, place smtps.lua wherever you need the module to be.
